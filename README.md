# Games
These are games I created while learning Python.

# Hangman
This is the first command line game (and the first program) I ever wrote.
It is a simple version of the classic Hangman game, where the player(s) guess a word chosen ramdomly by the machine.<br>
I wrote it for my daughter, who was 5 years old at the time.
