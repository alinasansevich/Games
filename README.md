# Hangman
This is the first command line game (and the first program) I ever wrote.
It is a simple version of the classic Hangman game, where the player(s) guess a word chosen ramdomly by the machine.
I wrote it for my daughter, who was 5 years old and learning to read and write English and Spanish at the time.
